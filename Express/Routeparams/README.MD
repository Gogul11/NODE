Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.

Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function.

The main theme of this code is to create a basic Express.js server that serves data from a JavaScript file (`data.js`) through various routes. The server responds to different HTTP GET requests:

(1) ->  The default route ("/") responds with a link to the "/data" route.

(2) ->  The "/data" route responds with the entire dataset from the `data.js` file in JSON format.The json() method is used to route the dataset in json format.

(3) ->  The "/data/list" route responds with a filtered subset of the data where the `id` property is equal to 2.

(4) ->  The "/data/list/:listnum" route responds with data filtered based on a specific name provided as a route parameter. If the name exists in the dataset, it returns the filtered data; otherwise, it responds with a 404 error.

Rout epatameter: 

    Route parameters in Express.js are placeholders in the route pattern of a URL that capture values specified by the client and make them available to the server for processing. They allow dynamic routing based on the values provided in the URL. Route parameters are defined by placing a colon (":") before the parameter name in the route pattern.

    Example : 

        /data/list/:listnum

        Where the listnum after a colon(:) is the route parameter and which can be accessed with "req.params.listname".The req.params is the Java Script object in key value paris where key is the 'listnum' and the value is 'url specified in the params position'

    
(5) ->  The "*" route handles all other requests and responds with a 404 error.


The code sets up an Express server to handle these routes and listens on port 5000.
