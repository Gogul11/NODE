This code demonstrates how to implement logging middleware in an Express.js application.

Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request (req) and response (res) objects, and the ability to call the next middleware function in the stack.

In this example, we're creating a middleware function called logDetails that logs the URL path, HTTP method, and current time for each incoming request.

The logDetails function in this code is a middleware function that logs details about each incoming request, including the URL path, HTTP method, and current time.

Middleware functions can be attached to specific routes using the app.get() method or applied globally to all routes using the app.use() method.

    Example : 
        app.use(logDetails) or app.get("/", logDetails, <CallBack>)


The app.use() method is used to bind middleware functions to the application. Middleware functions attached using app.use() are executed for every request reaching the server.

The next() function is called within middleware functions to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.

Logging middleware is an essential component of web applications for monitoring and debugging purposes. 

By implementing logging middleware in an Express.js application, developers can gain insight into the flow of requests and responses, helping toidentify and troubleshoot issues more effectively.
